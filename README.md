# Neverclear

Entropy normally collapses, but not here. Neverclear is a class to provide child
classes with a drawing experience similar to that of the
[Processing](http://processing.org) library.

## Usage

Fork this project, or copy Neverclear.gd around wherever you need it.
Create a Node2D anywhere, and attach a script to it.
In the script replace the `extends Node2D` line with `extends Neverclear`.
Now define `_draw()` and draw away!
